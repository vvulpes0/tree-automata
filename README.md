Tree Acceptors
==============

Introduction
------------

This is the beginning of a simple library
for bottom-up finite-state tree acceptors.


Currently implemented are:

* Constructing trees and acceptors
* A visualization of tree acceptors
* The emptiness problem


The use of a ranked alphabet is not assumed.
The emptiness problem is solved by reduction
to reachability in a hypergraph.
